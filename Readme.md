# workout-tracker
A workout tracker created in obsidian to control your data around exercises and workouts

I got tired of trying to find a workout tracker that worked for me, whether it was a paid subscription or my data being stored somewhere I couldn't control. So I finally created one on my own in obsidian

Start 

You can create your own exercises with notes and images attached

You can create your own workouts using the exercises created

## Requirements
- Obsidian
- Community Plugins
	- [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)
	- [Buttons](https://github.com/shabegom/buttons)
	- [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)

## Example

1. Start from` _Homepage.md`
2. Two buttons available at the top `Create Workout` and `Create Exercise`
3. Create an exercise by inputting the name and selecting the primary muscle group via the prompt
4. Create a workout by inputting the name via the prompt
5. From inside the newly created workout under the `exercises::` section use backlinks to attach the exercises you want for this workout
6. At the bottom of `_Homepage.md` there is a `Log Workout` button which allows you to select the workout for the day via a select prompt
7. Inside the newly created `workout-record` page click `Log Exercise` and select the exercise you want to log via the select prompt
8. The newly created exercise-record should now appear in the table below
9. Last record exercises should appear at the bottom as time goes on to show what you did the last time for that exercise regardless of the workout
